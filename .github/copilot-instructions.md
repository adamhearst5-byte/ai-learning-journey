Create a comprehensive, interactive, progress-trackable website for a 12-month self-directed AI learning journey (September 2025 to September 2026). The user has a foundation degree in software engineering from Northern Ireland, works full-time in retail at Sainsbury's (with 15-20 hours/week available for study), and aims to become a prime candidate for AI/IT roles by September 2026. Focus on AI interests like model complexities, base code, and underlying systems. Build the site using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with React for interactivity), and make it deployable on GitHub Pages. Include detailed progress tracking, curated learning resources, project ideas with templates, certification paths, career tools, and motivational features.

**User Profile and Constraints:**
- **Education:** Foundation degree in software engineering (covers basics like programming, SQL, web dev).
- **Work/Lifestyle:** Full-time retail; study in evenings/weekends. Include fatigue management tips and flexible scheduling.
- **Location:** Northern Ireland (e.g., Lisburn/Belfast) – Emphasize UK job market (remote opportunities, Belfast tech hubs like Catalyst), NI-specific resources (e.g., Invest NI programs), and post-Brexit EU access.
- **Interests:** Deep dive into AI model internals (e.g., neural network architectures, optimization algorithms, base code implementation).
- **Goals:** Build employable skills without a bachelor's top-up; achieve certifications, portfolio projects, and job readiness by September 2026. Target roles like Junior AI Engineer, ML Developer (UK salary range: £30k-£50k starting[21]).
- **Budget:** Prioritize free resources; cap paid items at £200 total (e.g., one premium course).
- **Challenges to Address:** Imposter syndrome, motivation dips, balancing work – Include coping strategies, success stories from similar transitions (e.g., retail to tech via self-study[27]).

**Website Architecture and Core Features:**
- **Tech Stack:** React.js for components (e.g., stateful progress trackers), Chart.js for visualizations, localStorage for data persistence, Bootstrap for responsive design. Provide a starter repo structure with folders for components, assets, and data.
- **Accessibility and Usability:** ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, dark mode, mobile responsiveness. Include a user guide for setup/customization.
- **Navigation:** Sidebar menu with sections: Dashboard, Timeline, Resources, Projects, Certifications, Progress Logs, Portfolio, Career Hub, Settings.
- **Integration Ideas:** Embed GitHub API for repo tracking, Google Calendar sync for reminders, RSS feed for AI news (e.g., from Towards Data Science).

4. **Project Ideas Section:**
   - 10 ideas with timelines, skill mappings, and GitHub starter templates.
   - Examples:
     - Beginner (Q1): Sentiment analysis tool – Modify base code of a simple ML model (2 weeks, demonstrates Python/AI basics[6]).
     - Intermediate (Q2): Custom neural network from scratch – Explore model internals (4 weeks, use TensorFlow[5]).
     - Advanced (Q3): AI chatbot with modified transformer base code – Focus on complexities (6 weeks[7]).
     - Capstone (Q4): End-to-end ML pipeline with MLOps (e.g., deploy on AWS, track model performance[8]).
   - Each: Description, required resources, evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy score), portfolio tips (e.g., demo video, code walkthrough).

5. **Certifications Section:**
