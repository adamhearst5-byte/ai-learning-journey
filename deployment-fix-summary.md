# ðŸš€ Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **GitHub Pages Branch Configuration Mismatch**
- **Problem**: GitHub Pages settings expect `gh-pages` branch, but deployment was using GitHub's native Pages deployment
- **Solution**: Switched to gh-pages branch deployment method that creates the required branch
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (disabled native deployment)
  - `.github/workflows/deploy-ghpages.yml` (enabled gh-pages deployment)

### 2. **Missing Asset Reference** (Previously Fixed)
- **Problem**: `index.html` referenced `logo192.png` which doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Removed the broken apple-touch-icon reference
- **File**: `public/index.html`
